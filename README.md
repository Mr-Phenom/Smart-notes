# Project Name

## Overview

This project is designed to provide users with a comprehensive solution for both note-taking and setting reminders. The application is divided into two main segments: Note-taking and Reminder setting. Users can easily manage their notes and set reminders for important events.

## Features

### Note-taking

- **Add Notes**: Users can create new notes, providing a simple and basic platform for jotting down thoughts or important information.

- **Update Existing Notes**: The ability to modify and update existing notes ensures flexibility and adaptability.

- **Delete Notes**: Users can remove unnecessary or outdated notes, maintaining a clutter-free environment.

### Reminder Setting

- **Date and Time Selection**: Users can choose the date and time for an event they want to be reminded of.

- **Notification and Alarm Options**: Two reminder options are available - Notification and Alarm.

  - **Notification**: Users can set a specific number of hours before the event to receive a notification. The app will push notifications until the event time, and users cannot remove or delete the notification until the event has passed.

  - **Alarm**: If the user selects the Alarm option, they will be reminded by an alarm at the event time.

- **Automatic Deletion of Notifications**: Once the event time has passed, the notification will be automatically deleted, reducing clutter in the notification panel.

## How to Use

1. **Note-taking**:
   - To add a new note, click on the "Add Note" button and enter your text.
   - To update an existing note, select the note and click on the "Update" option.

2. **Reminder Setting**:
   - Navigate to the "Reminders" section.
   - Choose the date and time for the event.
   - Select at least one reminder option (Notification, Alarm, or both).
